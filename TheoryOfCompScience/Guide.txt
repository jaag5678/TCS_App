This simple program takes user's input of a DFA (Which is in tabular format) and stores the DFA 
Rules so far for Defining a DFA :
	-> First mention no of states (state name so far can be only one char)
	-> Next Mention no of variables (So far assumed to be nos)
	-> Next mention the start state
	-> Next start filling the info of the DFA int a tabular form
		->Press Enter after fillling every row
	-> The program will detect the next state for which transitions to be filled in (LAzy eval)
	-> ONce done mention the no of final states followed by wrting the final states seperated by spaces

	->NExt you can give a string Input to test whether it exists in the language defined above
	-> Your Ans will be shown by:
		-> 0 - Meaning it doesnt exist
		-> 1 - Meaning it exists

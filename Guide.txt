This simple program takes user's input of a DFA and an NFA (Which is in tabular format) and stores the DFA 
Rules so far for Defining a DFA :
	-> First mention no of states (state name so far can be only one char)
	-> Next Mention no of variables (So far assumed to be nos)
	-> Next mention the start state
	-> Next start filling the info of the DFA int a tabular form
		->Press Enter after fillling every row
	-> The program will detect the next state for which transitions to be filled in (LAzy eval)
	-> ONce done mention the no of final states followed by wrting the final states seperated by spaces

	->NExt you can give a string Input to test whether it exists in the language defined above
	-> Your Ans will be shown by:
		-> 0 - Meaning it doesnt exist
		-> 1 - Meaning it exists
		
Rules so far for defining NFA:
	-> First mention no of states (state name so far can be only one char)
	-> Next Mention no of variables (So far assumed to be nos)
	-> Next mention the start state
	-> Next you will be prompted to give no of states the machine can go to for the variable 
		-> Keep entering the states with spaces and enter to enter for next var for given state
		-> Keep doing as prompted and fill the detials
	
	-> Now you can give the input string (ONE with PRESCRIBED ALPHABET ONLY)
		->Based on given string you will get and ans
			-> 0 - Meaning doesnt exist in language
			-> 1 - Exists in the LAnguage


NOTE:
	I'm still looking for bugs and optimizing code
	The main file has given a default input to NFA , you can tweeak it to accept your input
	I'm working on interrelating the 2 Automaton classes.
	I assume those who see this code know how to link and run it, if not I'll be creating a makefile soon.
	If any bugs found plz feel free to tell :))

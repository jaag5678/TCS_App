# TCS_App

Basic concept of Finite Automata applied
User can input his/her choice of Automata in the format of a mathematical table (Tabular Representation of FA).

User has 2 choices:
1) User can give a string to check if it belongs to given grammar
2) If the FA given is Nondeterministic, user has the choice to convert it to an equivalent Deterministic Form
    
Concepts needed to understand:
 1) vector template
 2) string 
 3) structures
 4) basics of classes
 
 NOTE: This was not an intended full fledged project, it was in the pursuit of understanding how to program and simulate FA in a system
        This micro project is for learning only. :)
        
 Happy Coding,
